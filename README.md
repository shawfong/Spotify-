# Spotify & Machine Learning
cs 244 final project

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze key features that contribute to a song’s success in reaching Spotify’s Top 200 playlists. Using a dataset containing daily playlist data from January 1, 2017, to May 29, 2023, we will explore various song attributes to determine their influence on chart performance.

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive exploration)

## Installation
